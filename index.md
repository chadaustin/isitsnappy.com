# Is It Snappy?

Has an app or device ever felt sluggish or laggy or unresponsive?  The most important performance metric is response latency: the time between the user pressing an input and observing the effect of that input.  Physical objects in the real world have a response latency near zero milliseconds, and it doesn't take much above that to start feeling uncomfortable to us.

Some people are more perceptive of response time latency than others, but fortunately we don't have to use subjective feelings to measure an application or device's response latency!  A traditional technique for quantifying response time is by simultaneously recording the button press and the screen with a high-speed camera and measuring the number of frames between the press and the result.

And since the iPhone 6, iPhones have a 240 Hz back-facing camera.  4.2 ms of precision in our pockets!

Is It Snappy? is an iOS app for quantifying response latency.

Simply record a video of the button press and screen change.

Then mark the two events.

Is It Snappy? will display the number of frames and milliseconds between the two events.

Quantifying response latency ends arguments! :)

You optimize what you measure.
